## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher


## Installation Guide

Please follow these steps to set up the extension:

1. **Check System Compatibility**: 
    - The extension is compatible with most systems running Python 3.8 or higher.
    - On non-standard systems, a C++ compiler is required to compile the `wuff` package.

2. **Install `wuff`**:
    - Install the `wuff` package into a Python virtual environment, the system-wide Python, or any other Python interpreter you have.
    - Use `pip install wuff` to install. `wuff` is a set of analyzer tools for WooWoo projects, developed in C++ for efficiency.
    - The package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wuff/#files).

3. **Install Extension**:
    - Install the WooWoo extension from the VSCode Marketplace.

4. **Open Command Menu**:
    - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) and search for the `Python: Select Interpreter` command.

5. **Select Interpreter**:
    - Choose the Python interpreter where you installed `wuff` in step 2.

6. **Finalize Setup**:
    - Your setup is complete! If needed, specify the dialect you are using (refer to the _Dialect Configuration_ section for details).
    - If the language server isn't working, run the `WooWoo VSCode: Restart Server` command from the command menu.


### Dialect Configuration

Language support in WooWoo is highly dependent on the specific dialect used. To ensure the extension operates correctly, you must specify your dialect unless you're using the default `FIT-Math` dialect.

1. **Access Settings**: Open VSCode settings with `Ctrl + ,` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + ,` (Mac).
2. **Search for WooWoo**: Type `WooWoo` in the settings search bar.
3. **Set Dialect File Path**: Find the `WooWoo-vscode: Dialect_file_path` setting and input the absolute path to your `.yaml` dialect file.
4. **Restart VSCode**: To apply the changes, restart VSCode.

The dialect file path you set is passed to the language server by the VSCode language server client upon startup.


## Language Server Features

Please visit [the official WooWoo Language Server repository](https://gitlab.fit.cvut.cz/woowoo/lsp/woowoo-language-server) to see the full list of features.


## Theme Choice and Semantic Highlighting

The choice of theme in VSCode plays a pivotal role in the semantic highlighting experience provided by the WooWoo LS. Some themes might use the same color for various token types, which could lead to suboptimal highlighting when working with WooWoo documents.
